# Hello Github World!
My very first Github repository

Hello, everyone! This is my very first GitHub repository.

I'm quite sure yet what I'll use it for, but I'll think of something.

I will be sharing some Python scripts for Blender here, as well as .blend files themselves, so watch for those. :)

## Other Interests:



I am very interested in Blender!

Their home page is https://www.blender.org.



I am also interested in SuperTux development.

You can check out their GitHub page at https://github.com/supertux/SuperTux, 
or their home page at http://supertux.github.io/index.html


I also dabble in programming, especially FreeBASIC and Python 3.
I can do a _very little_ C++, as a result of messing with microcontrollers and Arduio.

I will be sharing some of my programs here, too.

The FreeBASIC home page is at https://freebasic.net, and Python's home page is https://python.org.  Arduino's home page can be found at https://arduino.cc


That's all for now!
