#Installing

To install these scripts, copy them to where ever Blender keeps it's addons or anywhere on your Blender add-ons search path,
and you should be good to go!

Alternatively, in Blender User Preferences>>add-ons, click "Install from File...", browse to where you put the files, select the file you want, and click "Install from file"

That simple!

#####Note: These add-on scripts were written with Blender 2.7x in mind, so if you run an older version, they might not work.
#####  You can modify and/or redistribute them to your heart's content!

#Enjoy!
